LANGCODE:ca_ES
CHARSET: utf-8

NEEDSSORT:true

LANGINFO: <p>Catalan includes several special tiles, "L·L", "NY" and
LANGINFO: "QU" in addition to Ç.  There are no "Y" or "Q" tiles,
LANGINFO: and all words containing either of these letters not in
LANGINFO: combination with a "N" or "U" will be excluded from the
LANGINFO: dictionary. </p>

LANGINFO: <p>"L" is legal by itself, as are words in which two "L"s
LANGINFO: appear side-by-side.  The "L·L" tile is used whenever any of
LANGINFO: these three strings appears in the wordlist you upload:
LANGINFO: "L-L", "L.L" or "L·L".  (And of course "l-l", "l.l" or
LANGINFO: "l·l".)</p>

LANGINFO: <p>In addition to the special multi-letter tiles discussed
LANGINFO: above, the following letters are allowed: A-J, L-V, X, Z and
LANGINFO: Ç.  Lowercase letters will be converted to uppercase, then
LANGINFO: words containing letters not listed here will be excluded.</p>

LANGINFO: <p>The file you upload should be encoded in UTF-8.</p>

# NOTES:
#------
#    (1) - Just for avoiding character set mistakes: in the "INT." section of the Palm 
#          screen keyboard, this letter is on the first line, at the very right of "ae".
#    (2) - This is another curious catalan double-letter: two "L" separated by a dot.
#    (3) - In catalan, the "Y" is only used for the double-letter "NY".
#    (4) - In catalan, the tile is not [Q], i [QU]; because it is not possible to
#          use a "Q" alone.
#    (5) - Blank tile.
