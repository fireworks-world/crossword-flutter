LANGINFO: <p>The hex "language" is something of a programmers' joke.
LANGINFO: Hex is short for hexadecimal, a 16-base number system whose
LANGINFO: "digits" are the numerals 0-9 plus the letters A-F.  Hex
LANGINFO: letters are often used to represent computer data, and
LANGINFO: certain sequences are sometimes used as markers because
LANGINFO: they're easy to pick out in large dumps of otherwise
LANGINFO: meaningless (to humans) garbage.  In staring at Mac memory
LANGINFO: dumps, for example, you'd occasionally see the letters
LANGINFO: DEADBEEF and know that memory in that area was probably
LANGINFO: undamaged.</p>

LANGINFO: <p>I use Hex dictionaries for testing since they have few
LANGINFO: tiles and games play quickly.  That's also why the Hex
LANGINFO: tile set has four blanks; that's the largest number
LANGINFO: Crosswords supports and I needed to test at the limit.</p>



# High bit means "official".  Next 7 bits are an enum where Hex==127
# (I just made that up; not sure what it was originally.)  Low byte is
# padding
